# Robotathon ESP32

Hello!

This repository serves as the template codebase for Robotathon teams.

In this branch, you will find all the files necessary for an ESP32 project configured with all the required libraries for Robotathon (Arduino core and BluePad32 libraries).

Teams are welcome to modify anything and everything! The only restriction is your creativity :)
